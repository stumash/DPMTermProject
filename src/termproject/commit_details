the ArmManager, Localizer, USPoller, ColorPoller classes are all still empty. the ObstacleAvoidance class has not yet been created.  In this commit, I finished up the rotate and go methods of the navigator, and all that the Navigator needs now is the method that takes a point and brings the robot there, the goTo(double x, double y) method.  Possibly, the navigator class will also have rotation methods that do not block (don't wait for the desired rotation to finish before alloing other code to execute) since the localizer class will need that kind of functionality and for the sake of modular design the Navigator class should be the one to handle all behaviour of that nature.  I added some constants to the Constants class. I think that the next thing to is to finish the Navigator, whether or not that involves the non-blocking rotate methods, and then to do the Poller classes.  The ArmManager, Localizer and Obstacle Avoidance all need to use the functionality of the Odometer, Navigator and Pollers so they come first.
