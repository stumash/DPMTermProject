The arm manager and localizer are still empty and the Obstacle Avoidance is still not created. The ColorPoller, USPoller and Odometer classes have all been implemented as TimerListeners, and not as Threads. This decision was made due to the fact that in java, TimerListeners always execute in the opposite order that they were added as listeners to the Timer. I have also added some values to the Constants class. For the upcoming commit, I will implement the localizer and the obstacle avoidance - maybe even the arm manager.
