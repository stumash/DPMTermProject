Odometry Correction is likely not needed and will not be implemented. The only form of odometry correction that the robot will use
is to do re-localization using the light localization technique at various groundline intersections as it travels distances too large that
would usually cause a fatal buildup of cumulative error for the odometer.
On this note, however, the light localization routine is complete and tested - it is functional. It is implemented in the main class/method as 
the behaviour state "LIGHT_LOCALIZATION".

what's left to do: ball-grabbing strategy is, as of now, totally undetermined - we need one.  Thats the main task left to.
So far the robot can tell where it is and get around pretty well. with some periodic light-localizations to correct its accumulated odometry error
over large distance, it can basically get anywhere.  Obstacle avoidance may need some tweaks but basically done. 

assuming obstacle avoidance and the frequency of light localization are handled soon , the real task ahead is grabbing a ball, if e can do that, this project is 
actually gonna be a success in time.

so just grabbing a ball for next commit, hopefully.
