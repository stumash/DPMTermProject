this is the second commit/push. I added a new file to be tracked, a zipfile called javadocs that contains the javadocs of the project in their current state. I also modified the Odometer and the Navigator classes a bit, mostly just updated javadoc comments - hence the new javadoc.zip file being tracked.  The Navigator class got some new methods as well, but still much work to do. Mainly, the Localizer class is still completely empty and the ArmManager class is as well. Some important design decisions yet to be made: are the Odometer, USPoller and ColorPoller going to be Threads or TimerListeners? leaning towards the latter, will do some independent testing of the performance/order of execution of the timedOut() methods of multiple TimerListeners listening to the same Timer in order to make the Listener/Thread decision.  Other than all that, things are on schedule.
