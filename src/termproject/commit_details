Localizer completed: its strategy is that if you back up into a wall and continue backing up, the robot will align
itself with the wall and thus the robots heading and distance from nearby lines can be known for certain, even hardcoded if need be.

Navigator updated: duplicate methods were added for every method such that for any method x(params) there is now also 
a method x_imret(params).  the duplicate method return immediately, aka the robot can execute proceeding code while the motion is
being performed. These methods are needed for obstacle avoidance so that USPoller can be used for logic during movement.

USPoller modified: nullpointer error due to instantiation of SampleProvider object using port member variable that is first assigned value
in the constructor.  To fix, the SampleProvider instantiation (and all dependent assignments) were moved to the constructor whereas they were 
previously above it. Also, methods added to rotate the US sensor.

LCDinfo: this class was new and just added. it displays the current x, y and theta from the odometer to the screen.

Obstacle Avoidance: still empty

ArmManager: still empty

javadocs updated: no explanation necessary
