The final commit: wificlasses and color detection class added.
the main source of error of the robot is that it does not have accurate travelling over long distances.
likely best fixes would be improved odometry correction methods. the light localization method currently in place
for odometry correction works, but it relies on the robot being able to reliably reach the groundline intersection
around which to light-localize. this is a task that the robot has generally low chances of completing due to high
error margins in its directional accuracy.
